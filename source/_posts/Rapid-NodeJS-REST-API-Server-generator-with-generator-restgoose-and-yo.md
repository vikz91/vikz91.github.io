So I just finished writing and testing the all new generator-restgoose, inspired (forked) from Antonio. I basically changed the core pattern of how MVC code is generated and segregated them, optimized and upgraded many deprecated code, and updated the mocha test. Here is the Rapid NodeJS REST Server generator I have been talking about.

## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/KvLOBSb.jpg)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### Generator Restgoose

While running through a leafy mongodb field he picked up mongoose.   
Generator-Restgoose scaffolds all API Routes, API Objects ( Bussiness Logic), Schema Models, Test Cases, and even Documentation for you with full CRUD functionality. 

To install generator-restgoose from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-restgoose
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo restgoose
```
It should output a file structure similiar to:

```
.bowerrc
.editorconfig
.jshintrc
api/
apiObjects/
config/
... db.js
... lib.js
docs/
public/
models/
routes/
... index.js
test/
views/
bower.json
Gruntfile.js
package.json
Readme.md
```

- models - contains Mongoose Schema of an entity ( Data Layer)
- apiObjects - Contains business logic &amp; model access for each entity ( Business Layer )
- api - Contains routes of each entity ( Presentation Layer / Controller )
- test - contains unit test cases for each entity
- docs - contains Detailed `markdown` formatted documentation of each Schema generated through the sub-generator. 


Don't forget to checkout the `config/lib.js` file which contains many useful stuff (Json Validator, image to Base64 Converter, etc).
Use the Library as ``` var l = require('../config/lib.js); ``` ( which generates with every sub schema). 

Try to use ``` l.p('Print something'); ``` to log something. This will log to debug.log file. 

Logging
Two log files are served : debug.log and access.log.

All responses are in valid [jSend](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend) spec conformed JSON format.


### Run the app 

Development mode
```bash
$ grunt 
```
or

```bash
$ grunt server 
```

Production mode
```bash
$ grunt prod 
```



### Sub Generators 
#### Schema

Creates all required Model, Controllers, test cases, routes and documentations for a particular Schema. Run the sub generator for schemas:

```
$ yo restgoose:schema "article|title:String,excerpt:String,content:String,published:Boolean,created:Date"
```

output:
```
You're creating a schema for article
With the fields: title,excerpt,content,published,created
create routes/article.js
create models/article.js
starting request to schematic for test mock data...
create test/test-article.js
create doc/article.md
```

#### DeleteSchema

Deletes all files (Model, APi Route, API Object, Doc, Test) for a particular schema. Run the sub generator for deleteschema:

```
$ yo restgoose:deleteschema "article" --force
```
**N.B.** You need to use --force else y=Yeoman will continue asking you to overwrite each file.  
output:
```
You're deleting all files for schema: article

force api/article.js
force apiObjects/article.js
force models/article.js
force docs/article.md
force test/test-article.js
```
### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).


## Command List
* yo restgoose \<ProjectName\> - initiate a project
* yo restgoose:schema "\<schema\>|field:DataType" - Create all routers, models, test and docs for a schema
* yo restgoose:deleteschema "\<Schema\>" - Delete all related generated files for a schema
* grunt - start server with watch enabled
* npm test - Start Testing generated schemas

First off, I am really sorry for this long awaited update. Good News, a **lot** has changed in this update - Unified Response JSON object, conforming with spec, Documentation Generation, Great README file for both Yeoman Generator-Restgoose Project(this one) and your generated project! Oh and by the way, do check out the brand new sub-generator "deleteschema"!

* Migration   
With as much pain I can endure, this version of generator-restgoose is **not** backwards-compatible. This comes due to changing the core response object of all API endpoints. I will write up a blog page/[wiki](https://github.com/vikz91/generator-restgoose/wiki/Migrations) very soon for reasons, resolutions and troubleshooting. I personally regret inconveniences caused.  
Despite this, If you need more reasons to keep using this project, read on ...

	* Unified JSON response object \([jSend](https://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend)\)
	* Quick Auto Callback and Response Handlers ( check `config/lib.js`)

	* Wiki & FAQs
	* generated project README 
	* New Sub-Generator for deleting a schema, and its files.
* Optimizations & Upgrades
